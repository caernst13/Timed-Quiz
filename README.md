# Timed-Quiz

This project was about creating a quiz that involes a timer element and a local storage element. by clicking one of the answers you either increase or decrease the time remaining. when either time runs out or all questions are answered you are shown your score and given the option to save yuour name and score. 

Most of what I learned was about event listeners and how different classes can interact with each other as well as improving a lot at understanding how to control what is shown on the screan with appending or changing visibility of certain elements. of course always more to learn. For starter for sure some polishing can be done and a lot of improvments can be made to the high score aspect. I am really happy with how the question all load and work with each other.
